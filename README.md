# Advent of Code 2020
## TypeScript edition!
This year I've made the brave decision to not use CoffeeScript. Crazy, I know.

---

### **Setup**
Not much to it really. Just run:
```sh
yarn install
```

---

### **Running the code**
Also pretty simple:
```sh
yarn day [number]
# E.g. yarn day 1
```

---

### **About**
* All the code in this repo relies on [ts-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node) for running TypeScript without a compilation step.
* I've used [Volta](https://volta.sh) to pin Node@15, but that probably won't matter too much.
* Code lint & format on commit shouldn't be this hard to set up in 2020, but here we are. ESLint + Prettier to the rescue (again).
